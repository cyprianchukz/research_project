Below is a simple web application that collates information from different sources and displays it in a single interface. This project will use Python (Flask) for the backend, and JavaScript for the frontend. The sources in this case is mock APIs for simplicity.

Backend (Python - Flask)
First, set up a simple Flask server that will fetch data from different sources:
1. Install Flask
2. Create app.py

Frontend (HTML + JavaScript)
Create a simple HTML page that will fetch and display the collated data:
1. Create index.html

C Component (Optional)
Alternative need to integrate a C component for some specific processing, by creating a simple shared library and calling it from Python. Simple C function compiled into a shared library:
1. Create collate.c
2. Compile collate.c into a shared library
3. Modify app.py to use the C library

Running the Application:
1. Start the Flask server
2. Open index.html in a web browser

This is a creates an application that collates information from different sources using Python for the backend, and JavaScript for the frontend, with an optional C component for additional processing.
